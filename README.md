telegram game - SALIWS

This was the project I had hoped for ,but due to my little experience, I failed.
The original idea was that the player would appear in a city, a location for beginners. There are various NPCs that you can interact with, such as a blacksmith, a seamstress, an arena caretaker, and others. Also, the player can enter the maze, in which monsters and he can climb higher, on the floors, among which there would be cities.

At the moment, the quest template, movement, DB, battle system, purchase of skins, bug-filled and unfinished arena are made.

I hope someone decides to finish or completely redo this bot.

Thanks to google translator for the translation.
